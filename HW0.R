# In this hw0.R assignment, we want students to:
#   - learn how to write a trivial R script
#   - learn how to run an R script via the source() function
#   - learn to answer our "write code ..." questions with R code that
#     isn't too specific (I'll describe this point more in class)
# We're hoping that this small exericse will lead to less trouble on
# hw1.R, which requires a more meaningful R script.
#
# You should replace all occurrences of "..." with your code. If you'd
# like to replace a single "..." with more than one line of code
# before my line (using your own variables), you may certainly do
# that.

# We'll grade your homework by running this ".R" file via
#   source("hw0.R")

# Find the sum of the elements of the vector x.

# Write code to generate two random numbers from N(0, 1) and report
# their sum.
