# My solution to this homework uses information from the first two
# handouts and the Vector portion of the third handout.
#
# We'll grade your homework by running this ".R" file via
#   source("hw1.R")
# (in a directory containing the data files) and reading your code.

# Note that your code should work on the current data set, and also on
# a new data set. For example, if I ask for a sum, don't use "17",
# even if the sum is 17, because 17 will probably be wrong for a new
# data set. Instead, use sum(...), since this second solution will be
# correct even for a new data set.
#
# I recommend checking that your code works on the files WI_tiny and
# NY_tiny, which are fake data files for which you can check your
# computations by hand. Get your code working on them, and then switch
# to the real data files specified above. Your submitted code should
# use the real files, "WI_donations" and "NY_donations".
